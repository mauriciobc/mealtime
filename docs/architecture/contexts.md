# Context Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the contexts used in the application, including their responsibilities, communication patterns, and optimization strategies.

## Contexts

### UserContext
- Manages user authentication and session state.
- Provides methods for login, logout, and session persistence.

### LoadingContext
- Handles global loading state.
- Provides methods to start and stop loading indicators.

### ErrorContext
- Centralizes error handling.
- Provides methods to set and clear error messages.

### CatsContext
- Manages state related to cats.
- Supports CRUD operations and caching.

### FeedingContext
- Manages feeding schedules and logs.
- Integrates with notifications for feeding reminders.

### HouseholdContext
- Manages household members and permissions.
- Supports member management and role assignments.

## Communication Patterns
- **Event System**: Used for cross-context communication.
- **Context Bridges**: Facilitate state synchronization between contexts.

## Optimization Strategies
- **Memoization**: Reduces redundant computations.
- **State Selectors**: Optimizes re-renders by selecting specific slices of state.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks and logs performance metrics.

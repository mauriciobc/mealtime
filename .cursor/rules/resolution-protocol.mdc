# Issue Resolution Protocol

## Diagnostic Investigation
When encountering a test failure:

1. **Comprehensive Compatibility Assessment**
   - Verify issue's scope across entire codebase
   - Confirm reproducibility under different conditions
   - Document initial observations and potential impact

2. **Systematic Root Cause Analysis**
   - Generate 5-7 potential problem hypotheses
     * Consider architectural, implementation, dependency, and environmental factors
     * Rank hypotheses by probability and potential complexity
   - Critically evaluate each hypothesis
   - Distill to most likely 1-2 root causes

## Resolution Preparation
### Detailed Developer Guidance
Create a comprehensive resolution brief that includes:
- **Precise Diagnostic Insights**
  * Exact file locations
  * Specific line numbers affected
  * Detailed explanation of root cause
  * Potential downstream implications

- **Explicit Fix Instructions**
  * Step-by-step modification process
  * Code snippets demonstrating corrective action
  * Expected outcome and verification methods

## Implementation Strategy
- Execute fix with methodical precision
- Conduct thorough regression and unit testing
- Document entire diagnostic and resolution process
- Update relevant documentation or comments

## Guiding Principles
- Prioritize systematic investigation
- Maintain clarity and reproducibility
- Minimize potential for future regressions
- Facilitate knowledge transfer
